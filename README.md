# Login Authentication
A code designed to authenticate a user before creating and logining them into the website.

### How it works
- You start by creating an account, with the username, email, password, first name and last name required. Other fields are of user choice if to fill or not.
- Afterwards, you are redirected to the login page where you login.
- After a successfully login, you are moved to the home page where you can either update/delete/logout
